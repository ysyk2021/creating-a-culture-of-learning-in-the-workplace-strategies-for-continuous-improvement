Identifying strengths and areas for improvement is the next step in assessing your current workplace culture. This may involve analyzing the data collected during the cultural assessment to identify areas where the organization is excelling and areas where improvement is needed.

Developing a Plan for Improvement

Once you have identified areas for improvement, it's important to develop a plan for improvement.

Communicating the importance of a learning culture is another important step in creating a culture of learning in the workplace. This may involve explaining the benefits of a learning culture to employees and stakeholders, highlighting success stories from organizations that have successfully created a learning culture, and providing ongoing communication and support to employees as they work to incorporate learning into their daily activities.
